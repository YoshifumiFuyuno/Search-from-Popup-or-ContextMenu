# Search from Popup or ContextMenu (SPC)

This is a WebExtension for browsers.  
This Extension is a *fork* of "[Swift Selection Search (SSS)](#acknowledgment)".  

When you select text or image on a webpage, you can quickly search from the popup or contextmenu.

**By default, popup appears when you drag an image, selected text, or link, but you can choose from the following behaviors.**  
  "Popup/icons behaviour" -> "Opening behaviour":  
  (Off / Auto / Hold Alt / Keyboard-only / Middle mouse button / Click / Drag)

There are Firefox and Microsoft Edge(Chrome) versions.  
Microsoft Edge version also works with Chromium-based browsers such as Chrome, but there's no technical support.
